  Study_Description: "ROS is a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study of aging\
    \ and Alzheimer's disease (AD) run from Rush University that enrolled individuals\
    \ from religious communities for longitudinal clinical analysis and brain donation.\
    \ MAP is a longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical-pathologic cohort study of common\
    \ chronic conditions of aging with an emphasis on decline in cognitive and motor\
    \ function and risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease that began in 1997 and is run\
    \ from Rush University. This study was designed to complement the ROS study by\
    \ enrolling individuals with a wider range of life experiences and socioeconomic\
    \ status into a study of similar structure and design as ROS. "
  Dataset_name: ROSMAP snRNAseq Dataset Pseudo-Bulk data
